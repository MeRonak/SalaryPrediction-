B)The dataset(Experience vs Salary) that I used is from kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/codebreaker619/salary-data-with-age-and-experience)

C) for training my model I used Linear Regression because i found it to be the best as it was clear from the scatter plot of the raw data that the best fit will a straight
line, I used sklearn library, it can also be done without the use of library.
